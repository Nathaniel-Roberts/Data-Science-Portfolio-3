## Analysis of an E-commerce Dataset Part 3
This was our final task, dealing with the E-Commerce Dataset. We started by exploring the data and cleaning it up. We then had to covert the object features into digit features by utilising an encoder. We then created a heat map to study the correlation between all the features.
After this, we split up the dataset to train a logistic regression model to help predict the 'rating' based on other features. We analysed these results. After this, we trained a KNN model to see how the accuracy would compare and completed discussions on these results.
